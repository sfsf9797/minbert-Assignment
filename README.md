# minbert Assignment

This is an exercise in developing a minimalist version of BERT, part of Carnegie Mellon University's [CS11-747: Neural Networks for NLP](http://www.phontron.com/class/nn4nlp2020/).

In this assignment, you will implement some important components of the BERT model to better understanding its architecture. 

This repo contains my implementation for the assignment.
